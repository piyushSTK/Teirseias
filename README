This project was made for IDP course in IIT Hyderabad. The image detection module and the code was taken from 
https://towardsdatascience.com/object-detection-with-10-lines-of-code-d6cb4d86f606.   We used the pretrained model
given in the site and implemented it in raspberry PI 3 B+.
The project works as communiication between server(laptop) and node(raspberry)
In the event of press of a button a python script is triggered which establishes ssh connection between rasp and server.
Then automatically an image is captured using the picamera and image is sent to server using scp.
The server recives the images and processes the images and stores the label names ima text file.
Now using gTTS module the text is converted to audio and is sent to raspberry pi.
